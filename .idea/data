Don't lie, I know you've been thinking it
And two times, you let it slip from your lips
You've got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time, and you want to keep it in
I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Prayin' to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please
Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
