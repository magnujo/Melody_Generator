This is an application that generates musical melodies based on different user inputs. It was made by Andreas Dafnopulos Hansen, Hannah Jensen Tyedmers, Kristian Andreasen and Magnus Johannsen as a computer science project at Roskilde University.

JSYN must be added as a library to the project folder, in order for the application to work. Download the library here: http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/developers/download.php
